This webpage was made as part of a learning course which taught HTML, CSS and responsive web design, therefore, I did not design this page. It is a page for a food company who both makes and delivers food, with many different sections and components. This was my first time using HTML and CSS and ever since I finished the course I've been creating many different webpages and such, expanding my knowledge of front-end development and responsive web design, amongst other things.
